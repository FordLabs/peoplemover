                        Most allocation applications focus solely on projects and schedules, and seem
                        to forget that a product is only as successful as its team. PeopleMover focuses on the people,
                        helping you create and fluidly maintain balanced teams well suited for the product at hand –
                        because we understand that a great team sets the stage for incredible results.
